## How to play

You will need a new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar or a [Touch Bar Simulator](https://github.com/bikkelbroeders/TouchBarDemoApp).

[‚¨áÔ∏è Download the latest release here ‚¨áÔ∏è](https://github.com/insidegui/TouchBarSpaceFight/releases).

Run the game and look at your touch bar, the game runs in there. Use the arrow keys to move the player and the space key to shoot, your goal is to avoid being hit by enemies and use the least amount of shots possible to destroy as many enemies as possible.

### Disclaimer

This is a very simple and buggy project, it's just a fun little hack to see what the touch bar is capable of, I will not support this in any way üò¨
